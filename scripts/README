These scripts are configured to perform backups to a remote SSH filesystem.

To install zbackup/rzbackup and initialize a new remote backup store run the
rzinstall script. Make sure you copy and store the secret/password somewhere
safe, in case a restore is needed this secret/password will be required to 
perform a restore, without it your backups are useless.

To run periodic backups create a cronjob pointing to the rzbackup script.

To restore install a bare minimal linux server, install rzbackup and run the
rzrestore script.

All backups are encrypted on the client before being uploaded, hence backups
can be placed on 3rd party servers.

The scripts use FUSE sshfs to communicate with a remote server where they will
place any backups and restore from.

The scripts assume that you have configured SSH keys for automatic login.
For more information on setting up SSH keys please see:

If you control the remote server you should make sure it's securely configured,
this includes but is not limited to:
    1. Make sure the server is fully patched and up to date
    2. Consider using a non-standard SSH port instead of port 22
    3. Consider forbidding password based logins via SSH
    4. The remote server should not allow the backup client to delete or modify
       any existing files, only add new files. This ensures that even if your
       client is compromised your backups are secure.
    5. The backup server should implement quotas so that if a client is
       compromised it can't disrupt the operation of the backup server
    6. All client logins should run in chrooted environments

And last but not least, always test restoring backups, a backup that has not
been restored is no backup at all!
