This script is configured to perform encrypted compresssed backups to remote
SSH filesystems using FUSE sshfs and zbackup.

To install zbackup/rzbackup from a local copy run "rzbackup install".

To install directly from github run:
bash -c "source <(wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/jalli/rzbackup/master/scripts/rzbackup) install"

To create a new backup repository on a remote host run "rzbackup create_repo"
Make sure you copy and store the secret/password somewhere
safe, in case a restore is needed this secret/password will be required to
perform a restore, without it your backups are useless.

To peroform a backup install rzbackup and run "rzbackup backup"

To restore install a bare minimal linux server, install rzbackup and run
"rzbackup restore".

All backups are encrypted on the client before being uploaded, hence backups
can be placed on 3rd party servers.

The scripts use FUSE sshfs to communicate with a remote server where they will
place any backups and restore from.

For rzbackup to run from cron make sure that you have configured SSH keys for
automatic login.

For more information on setting up SSH keys please see:

If you control the remote server you should make sure it's securely configured,
this includes but is not limited to:
    1. Make sure the server is fully patched and up to date
    2. Consider using a non-standard SSH port instead of port 22
    3. Consider forbidding password based logins via SSH
    4. The remote server should not allow the backup client to delete or modify
       any existing files, only add new files. This ensures that even if your
       client is compromised your backups are secure.
       Consider running a cronjob that changes ownership, but allows read only
       access by the users primary group which only the user belongs to.
    5. The backup server should implement quotas so that if a client is
       compromised it can't disrupt the operation of the backup server
    6. All client logins should run in chrooted environments

And last but not least, always test restoring backups, a backup that has not
been restored is no backup at all!
